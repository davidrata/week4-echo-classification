#  Echo Classification Using Unsupervised Learning

## Introduction

Echo classification is a crucial task in remote sensing and environmental monitoring. By analyzing satellite echoes, we can distinguish between open water leads and ice-covered areas, which is vital for understanding sea ice dynamics, climate change, and navigation safety in polar regions. This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to classify echoes into **leads** and **sea ice**, providing statistical insights and model evaluation.

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Week 4 assignment for echo classification. The goal is to classify echoes into **leads** and **sea ice**, compute their **average echo shape and standard deviation**, and compare the results with ESA's classification using a **confusion matrix**.

## Files in This Repository
- `Chapter1_Unsupervised_Learning_Methods.ipynb` - The main notebook containing the code and results.
- `data/` - (Optional) Folder for dataset files if required.
- `results/` - (Optional) Folder containing output plots or generated results.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy sklearn matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Use This Notebook
1. **Open in Google Colab**: You can open this notebook in Google Colab by uploading it to your Google Drive and accessing it via Colab.
2. **Run the Code**: Execute the cells in order to perform classification and evaluation.
3. **Modify if Needed**: Adjust parameters for clustering or classification based on your dataset.

## Steps Performed in This Notebook
1. **Data Loading** - Reads the dataset from Google Drive.
2. **Echo Classification** - Uses clustering (K-Means) to classify echoes into leads and sea ice.
3. **Statistical Analysis** - Computes average echo shape and standard deviation.
4. **Confusion Matrix** - Compares the results with ESA's official classification.
5. **Visualization** - Plots echo distributions and classification results.

## Example Results
After running the notebook, you should see the following key results:

### Average Echo Shape & Standard Deviation
To better understand the characteristics of each classified group, we compute the **average echo shape** and **standard deviation** for both **leads** and **sea ice**. These statistical insights help quantify differences in reflectance properties between the two categories.

- The visualization highlights that **leads** generally have higher variation compared to **sea ice**, suggesting differences in surface reflectance properties.
- The **distribution shape for sea ice is more consistent**, indicating a more uniform structure compared to leads.

### Clustered Echo Classification (K-Means & GMM)
The final clustering results show how our unsupervised learning techniques categorize echoes into **leads** and **sea ice**. A scatter plot of the clustered data provides a visual confirmation that our method successfully differentiates between the two classes.

### Key Takeaways

- The model achieved an **overall accuracy of nearly 100%**, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing **sea ice** from **leads**.
- The confusion matrix shows that out of **12,195 samples**, only a small number were misclassified (**22 sea ice samples as leads and 24 lead samples as sea ice**). This suggests that the clustering approach is highly reliable.
- **Precision and recall values close to 1.00** indicate that the model is both highly precise (very few false positives) and highly sensitive (almost all actual cases are correctly classified).
- The **F1-score of 0.99-1.00** confirms that the balance between precision and recall is optimal, meaning that the model is neither over-predicting nor under-predicting one category over another.
- The very low misclassification rate suggests that our clustering approach aligns well with ESAâ€™s official classification, making it a valuable tool for remote sensing applications.
- Although performance is excellent, further improvements could involve testing different clustering methods or incorporating additional features (e.g., temperature or salinity data) to refine classification boundaries.

These results indicate that the model provides a strong foundation for **automated sea ice classification**, which can be beneficial for climate research, navigation, and remote sensing applications.
