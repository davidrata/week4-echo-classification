#  Classification Using Unsupervised Learning

## Introduction

Echo classification is a crucial task in remote sensing and environmental monitoring. By analyzing satellite echoes, we can distinguish between open water leads and ice-covered areas, which is vital for understanding sea ice dynamics, climate change, and navigation safety in polar regions. This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to classify echoes into **leads** and **sea ice**, providing statistical insights and model evaluation.

## **Overview**  

This notebook explores **unsupervised learning methods** for classifying sea ice and leads using **remote sensing data** from Sentinel-2 (optical imagery) and Sentinel-3 (altimetry data). Unsupervised learning is valuable in Earth Observation (EO) applications where labeled data is limited or unavailable.  

We implement **two clustering techniques** to differentiate between sea ice and leads:  
1. **K-Means Clustering** â€“ A simple and efficient algorithm that assigns each data point to the nearest cluster centroid.  
2. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** â€“ A probabilistic clustering method that captures more nuanced variations in the data.  

The notebook follows these key steps:  

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Loading Sentinel-2 optical bands and Sentinel-3 altimetry data.  
   - Extracting relevant features, including **peakiness and stack standard deviation (SSD)** from altimetry waveforms.  
   - Standardizing data for clustering analysis.  

2. **Clustering & Classification:**  
   - Applying **K-Means and GMM** to segment Sentinel-2 optical data into two classes: **sea ice and leads**.  
   - Using **GMM clustering** to classify Sentinel-3 altimetry waveforms based on extracted features.  

3. **Statistical Analysis:**  
   - Computing the **average waveform shape** and **standard deviation** for classified echoes.  
   - Comparing the variability between sea ice and leads to validate classification accuracy.  

4. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - **Confusion matrix analysis**: Comparing the clustering results against the official **ESA classification dataset**.  
   - Evaluating **precision, recall, and overall accuracy** to assess model performance.  

### **Ultimate Goal**  
The primary objective of this notebook is to **quantify echo classification performance** by:  
âœ… Classifying **sea ice vs. leads** using clustering techniques.  
âœ… Computing **average waveform properties** for each class.  
âœ… Comparing results against **ESA's official classification** using a confusion matrix.

## Expected Results

After running the notebook, you should see the following key results:

1. **Average Echo Shape & Standard Deviation**  
   - To better understand the characteristics of each classified group, we compute the **average echo shape** and **standard deviation** for both **leads** and **sea ice**.  
   - These statistical insights help quantify differences in reflectance properties between the two categories.  

2. **Clustered Echo Classification (K-Means & GMM)**  
   - The final clustering results show how our unsupervised learning techniques categorize echoes into **leads** and **sea ice**.  
   - A scatter plot of the clustered data provides a visual confirmation that our method successfully differentiates between the two classes.  

3. **Confusion Matrix**  
   - The confusion matrix provides a direct comparison between our classification and ESA's official labels.  
   - It helps measure **accuracy and misclassification rates**, ensuring that our model aligns well with real-world data.
