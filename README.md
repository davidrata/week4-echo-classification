# Week 4 - Echo Classification

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Week 4 assignment for echo classification. The goal is to classify echoes into **leads** and **sea ice**, compute their **average echo shape and standard deviation**, and compare the results with ESA's classification using a **confusion matrix**.

## Files in This Repository
- `Chapter1_Unsupervised_Learning_Methods.ipynb` - The main notebook containing the code and results.
- `data/` - (Optional) Folder for dataset files if required.
- `results/` - (Optional) Folder containing output plots or generated results.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy sklearn matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Use This Notebook
1. **Open in Google Colab**: You can open this notebook in Google Colab by uploading it to your Google Drive and accessing it via Colab.
2. **Run the Code**: Execute the cells in order to perform classification and evaluation.
3. **Modify if Needed**: Adjust parameters for clustering or classification based on your dataset.

## Steps Performed in This Notebook
1. **Data Loading** - Reads the dataset from Google Drive.
2. **Echo Classification** - Uses clustering (K-Means) to classify echoes into leads and sea ice.
3. **Statistical Analysis** - Computes average echo shape and standard deviation.
4. **Confusion Matrix** - Compares the results with ESA's official classification.
5. **Visualization** - Plots echo distributions and classification results.

## Example Results
After running the notebook, you should get:
- A **classification** of echoes into leads and sea ice.
- A **computed confusion matrix** to assess the accuracy against ESA's classification.
- **Plots** showing average echo shapes and classification performance.

## How to Upload to GitHub
